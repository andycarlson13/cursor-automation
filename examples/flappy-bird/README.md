# Flappy Bird MCP Demo

This example demonstrates a simple Flappy Bird clone that can be analyzed using Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents.

## Game Features

- Simple Flappy Bird gameplay
- Score tracking
- Game over and restart functionality
- Mobile-friendly design

## Files Included

- `index.html` - The game's HTML structure and styling
- `game.js` - Game logic and mechanics
- `mcp-analysis.js` - Demonstration of how MCP can analyze and improve the game
- `mcp-report.json` - Generated analysis report (created when you run the analysis)

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click the "Start Game" button
3. Click or press spacebar to make the bird fly
4. Avoid hitting the pipes or the ground
5. Try to get the highest score you can!

## MCP Analysis Demo

This example includes a script that simulates how MCP agents can analyze and suggest improvements for the game:

```bash
# First start all MCP servers
npm run start-all-mcp

# Then run the analysis script
node examples/flappy-bird/mcp-analysis.js
```

The analysis demonstrates the full power of MCP integration using all available agents:

1. **Filesystem MCP**

   - Code structure analysis
   - Performance optimization
   - Best practices review
   - Directory-specific analysis

2. **Puppeteer MCP**

   - UI/UX evaluation
   - Accessibility testing
   - Responsive design verification
   - Browser compatibility checks

3. **GitHub MCP**

   - Version control integration
   - Code review automation
   - Repository management
   - Branch protection

4. **Fetch MCP**

   - Network request analysis
   - API interaction testing
   - Resource loading optimization
   - Performance monitoring

5. **Sequential MCP**

   - Multi-step analysis coordination
   - Complex reasoning tasks
   - Dependency chain analysis
   - Integrated improvements

6. **WebResearch MCP**
   - Modern gaming trends analysis
   - Best practices research
   - Community feedback integration
   - Competitive analysis

## Learning Objectives

This example showcases:

- How MCP agents can analyze frontend applications
- Integration between multiple MCP agents for comprehensive analysis
- How AI can provide actionable insights for code improvement
- Advanced MCP orchestration for complex tasks

## Extending the Example

You can use this as a starting point for more complex game development or MCP integrations:

- Add real sprite animations using an image atlas
- Implement the suggested improvements from the MCP analysis
- Create sophisticated multi-agent analyses
- Develop custom MCP integrations

## MCP Server Configuration

To run all MCP servers:

```bash
# Start individual servers
npm run mcp-fs           # Filesystem MCP
npm run mcp-puppeteer    # Puppeteer MCP
npm run mcp-github       # GitHub MCP
npm run mcp-fetch        # Fetch MCP
npm run mcp-sequential   # Sequential MCP
npm run mcp-webresearch  # WebResearch MCP

# Or start all at once
npm run start-all-mcp
```
