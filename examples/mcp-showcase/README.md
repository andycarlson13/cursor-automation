# MCP Agents Showcase

This showcase demonstrates how Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents work together to analyze, improve, and generate code. We'll use a Flappy Bird game implementation as our example project.

## MCP Agents in Action

### 1. Filesystem MCP

The Filesystem agent helps manage and analyze our codebase:

```json
{
  "gameConfig": {
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "pipeGap": 225,
    "speed": 3
  }
}
```

This agent handles file operations, configuration management, and codebase organization.

### 2. Puppeteer MCP

The Puppeteer agent performs automated testing and validation:

- Loads and tests game canvas
- Verifies game initialization
- Captures gameplay screenshots
- Validates user interactions

### 3. GitHub MCP

The GitHub agent manages our repository and tracks changes:

- Branch protection rules
- Code review automation
- Dependency updates
- Repository maintenance

### 4. WebResearch MCP

The WebResearch agent gathers optimization insights:

```json
{
  "gameImprovements": [
    {
      "topic": "Game Mechanics",
      "improvements": [
        "Add difficulty levels",
        "Implement power-ups",
        "Add score multipliers",
        "Create obstacle variations"
      ]
    },
    {
      "topic": "Performance",
      "improvements": [
        "Use requestAnimationFrame",
        "Implement sprite batching",
        "Optimize collision detection",
        "Cache frequently used objects"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Fetch MCP

The Fetch agent handles API interactions:

```json
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "name": "Leaderboard API",
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/api/leaderboard",
      "status": "Success"
    },
    {
      "name": "Score Submission",
      "method": "POST",
      "path": "/api/scores",
      "status": "Success"
    },
    {
      "name": "Game Config",
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/api/config",
      "status": "Success"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6. Sequential MCP

The Sequential agent analyzes game logic and flow:

```json
{
  "gameLoop": {
    "sequence": [
      "Initialize game state",
      "Handle user input",
      "Update bird position",
      "Update pipe positions",
      "Check collisions",
      "Update score",
      "Render frame"
    ],
    "optimizations": [
      "Implement frame rate independent movement",
      "Use object pooling for pipes",
      "Optimize collision checks"
    ]
  },
  "userInteraction": {
    "sequence": [
      "Detect input event",
      "Apply impulse to bird",
      "Update bird rotation",
      "Play sound effect"
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Add touch/click feedback",
      "Smooth out bird rotation",
      "Implement variable jump height"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Running the Showcase

1. Start all MCP servers:

```bash
npm run start-all-mcp
```

2. Run the comprehensive test:

```bash
npm run test:full
```

3. View the results in the `test-results` directory:

- `game-improvements.json`: WebResearch MCP findings
- `api-tests.json`: Fetch MCP endpoint tests
- `game-analysis.json`: Sequential MCP analysis
- `game-screenshot.png`: Puppeteer MCP validation

## Learning from the Results

This showcase demonstrates how MCP agents work together to:

1. **Analyze Code**: Understanding existing codebase structure and patterns
2. **Generate Improvements**: Suggesting optimizations and new features
3. **Validate Changes**: Testing and verifying implementations
4. **Document Progress**: Creating clear documentation and examples

Each agent specializes in different aspects of development:

- Filesystem MCP: Code organization and file management
- Puppeteer MCP: UI testing and validation
- GitHub MCP: Version control and collaboration
- WebResearch MCP: Research and optimization
- Fetch MCP: API integration and testing
- Sequential MCP: Logic flow and analysis

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Analysis**: Use WebResearch and Sequential MCPs to understand the problem
2. **Plan Changes**: Use GitHub MCP to manage development workflow
3. **Implement Features**: Use Filesystem MCP to organize and write code
4. **Test Everything**: Use Puppeteer and Fetch MCPs to validate changes
5. **Document Results**: Keep this showcase updated with new findings

## Contributing

Feel free to add your own examples and improvements to this showcase. The goal is to demonstrate the power of MCP agents in real-world development scenarios.
